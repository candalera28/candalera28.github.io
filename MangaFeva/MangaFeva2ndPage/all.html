                                                The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years,
                                                 with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting
                                                 . This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual. <br><br>
                                                 Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair
                                                 fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has
                                                  borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique
                                                   ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor! 
                                                   <br><br>
                                                   Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent
                                                   hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and 
                                                   the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.

                                            Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though 
                                            living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day,
                                             Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing
                                              Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the

                                               When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still,
                                                the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to
                                                 avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, 
                                                 Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.

                                            After the destruction of their hometown, childhood friends Kafka Hibino and Mina Ashiro make a pact to become officers in the 
                                            Defense Force—a militarized organization tasked with protecting Japan from colossal monsters known as "kaijuu." Decades later,
                                             the 32-year-old Kafka has all but given up on his dreams of heroism. Instead, he cleans up the remains of the slaughtered kaijuu
                                              after they are defeated by valiant soldiers—including Mina, who has successfully achieved their shared goal.
                                               <br><br>
                                               Upon meeting his new coworker, Reno Ichikawa, Kafka faces a mirror of his past self: an ambitious young man whose one desire is to 
                                               fight as a member of the Defense Force. Unfortunately, the two are soon involved in a freak encounter with a rogue kaijuu. Though Kafka
                                                demonstrates his innate heroic nature and rescues Reno from certain doom, he is left gravely injured.
                                                <br><br>
                                                While both men recover in a hospital, Kafka is seemingly attacked by another one of the beasts. As a result, he gains the ability to transform 
                                                into a humanoid kaijuu with the strength and powers of the massive monsters menacing Japan. Dubbed "Kaijuu No. 8" by the military, Kafka resolves
                                                 to use his newfound gifts for the greater good. Tied together by mutual respect, Kafka and Reno set out to join warriors like Mina at the forefront
                                                  of the Defense Force.

                                            On the surface, the thought of Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura getting along would be the last thing in people's minds. After all, Hori has a perfect 
                                            combination of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears meek and distant to his fellow classmates. However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both
                                             of their hidden selves bare. Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends due to housework. On the other hand,
                                              Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent.

                                               Having opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become friends and often spend time together 
                                               in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.

                                            Nasa Yuzaki is determined to leave his name in the history books. Ranking first in the national mock exam and aiming for a 
                                            distinguished high school, he is certain that he has his whole life mapped out. However, fate is a fickle mistress. On his way
                                             home one snowy evening, Nasa's eyes fall upon a peerless beauty across the street. Bewitched, Nasa tries to approach her—only 
                                             to get blindsided by an oncoming truck.

                                               Thankfully, his life is spared due to the girl's swift action. Bleeding by the side of an ambulance, he watches as the girl
                                                walks away under the moonlight—reminiscent of Princess Kaguya leaving for the moon. Refusing to let this chance meeting end,
                                                 he forces his crippled body to chase after her and asks her out. Surprised by his foolhardiness and pure resolve, the girl 
                                                 accepts his confession under a single condition: they can only be together if he marries her!

                                            Kazuya Kinoshita is a 20-year-old college student who has a wonderful girlfriend: the bright and sunny Mami Nanami. But suddenly, 
                                            he doesn't. Without warning, Mami breaks up with him, leaving him utterly heartbroken and lonely. Seeking to soothe the pain, he 
                                            hires a rental girlfriend through an online app. His partner is Chizuru Mizuhara, who through her unparalleled beauty and cute
                                             demeanor, manages to gain Kazuya's affection.

                                               But after reading similar experiences other customers had had with Chizuru, Kazuya believes her warm smile and caring personality 
                                               were all just an act to toy with his heart, and he rates her poorly. Aggravated, Chizuru lambastes him for his shameless hypocrisy,
                                                revealing her true pert and hot-tempered self. This one-sided exchange is cut short, however, when Kazuya finds out that his 
                                                grandmother has collapsed.

                                                 who this girl might be. On impulse, Kazuya promptly declares that they are lovers, forcing Chizuru to play the part. But with

                                            Nonetheless, he goes to great lengths to keep his unique hobby a secret, as he believes that he would be ridiculed were it revealed.

                                               Nevertheless, scattered among Futaba's unpleasant memories are the treasured moments with the boy she had a crush on, Kou Tanaka. 
                                               Unfortunately, that spell abruptly ended on a sour note when he suddenly stopped attending school and never came back. When Futaba 
                                               finds out that Kou has returned—with a different last name this time—she can already feel the butterflies in her stomach. However, 
                                               Kou Mabuchi is not the warm boy that she remembers from her days in middle school; he is now taller, more charismatic and 
                                               withdrawn—making him far less approachable
                                               <br><br>
                                               Futaba believes that if she returns to her former self, Kou will begin to take notice of her again. But is she prepared to 
                                               sacrifice her bubble of normalcy and risk losing her friends in the process?

                                            WCenturies ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear 
                                            behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger 
                                            but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, 
                                            resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan 
                                            manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

                                            To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result.

                                              The late King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger, stirred up the world before his death by disclosing the whereabouts of his hoard of riches and
                                               daring everyone to obtain it. Ever since then, countless powerful pirates have sailed dangerous seas for the prized One Piece only to never
                                                return. Although Luffy lacks a crew and a proper ship, he is endowed with a superhuman ability and an unbreakable spirit that make him not
                                                 only a formidable adversary but also an inspiration to many.
                                                 <br><br>
                                                 As he faces numerous challenges with a big smile on his face, Luffy gathers one-of-a-kind companions to join him in his ambitious endeavor, 
                                                 together embracing perils and wonders on their once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

                                            Denji is robbed of a normal teenage life, left with nothing but his deadbeat father's overwhelming debt. His only companion is his pet, the chainsaw 
                                            devil Pochita, with whom he slays devils for money that inevitably ends up in the yakuza's pockets. All Denji can do is dream of a good, simple life: 
                                            one with delicious food and a beautiful girlfriend by his side. But an act of greedy betrayal by the yakuza leads to Denji's brutal, untimely death, 
                                            crushing all hope of him ever achieving happiness.

                                              Remarkably, an old contract allows Pochita to merge with the deceased Denji and bestow devil powers on him, changing him into a hybrid able to transform
                                               his body parts into chainsaws. Because Denji's new abilities pose a significant risk to society, the Public Safety Bureau's elite devil hunter Makima 
                                               takes him in, letting him live as long as he obeys her command. Guided by the promise of a content life alongside an attractive woman, Denji devotes 
                                               everything and fights with all his might to make his naive dreams a reality.

                                            In the distant future, humanity has been driven to near-extinction by giant beasts known as Klaxosaurs, forcing the surviving humans to take refuge in massive 
                                            fortress cities called Plantations. Children raised here are trained to pilot giant mechas known as FranXX—the only weapons known to be effective against the 
                                            Klaxosaurs—in boy-girl pairs. Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove 
                                            their existence by defending their race.

                                              Hiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class' graduation ceremony, 
                                              Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, 
                                              which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the "Partner Killer." Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden 
                                              Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero 
                                              Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner by his side, Hiro has been given 
                                              a chance at redemption for his past failures, but at what cost?

                                            Hitohito Tadano is an ordinary boy who heads into his first day of high school with a clear plan: to avoid trouble and do his best
                                             to blend in with others. Unfortunately, he fails right away when he takes the seat beside the school's madonna—Shouko Komi. 
                                             His peers now recognize him as someone to eliminate for a chance to sit next to the most beautiful girl in class.

                                              Gorgeous and graceful with long, dark hair, Komi is universally adored and immensely popular despite her mysterious persona.
                                               However, unbeknownst to everyone, she has crippling anxiety and a communication disorder which prevents her from wholeheartedly
                                                socializing with her classmates.
                                                <br><br>
                                                When left alone in the classroom, a chain of events forces Komi to interact with Tadano through writing on the blackboard, 
                                                as if in a one-way conversation. Being the first person to realize she cannot communicate properly, Tadano picks up the chalk 
                                                and begins to write as well. He eventually discovers that Komi's goal is to make one hundred friends during her time in high school.
                                                 To this end, he decides to lend her a helping hand, thus also becoming her first-ever friend.

                                        <p>
                                            After her boyfriend breaks up with her for another girl, college student Akane Kinoshita wrestles with a broken heart and the memories 
                                            he left behind. Loading up Forest of Savior, the MMO they used to play together, she forms a plan to get back at her ex-boyfriend through
                                             an in-person event for the game. In the process, she runs into someone unexpected: Akito Yamada, a gaming legend who just happens to be her
                                              guildmate.
                                              <br><br>
                                              Desperate for support, Akane ropes the asocial Yamada into helping with her scheme and lending her a shoulder to cry on. The differences 
                                              between Akane and Yamada soon become apparent as they spend time together, yet they cannot help but notice each other's inner qualities. 
                                              As the two gain more experience with one another in and out of the game, their tentative acquaintance may level up in a way neither expects.

                                            The "God of High School" tournament has begun, seeking out the greatest fighter among Korean high school students! All martial arts styles, 
                                            weapons, means, and methods of attaining victory are permitted. The prize? One wish for anything desired by the winner.
                                              <br><br>
                                              Taekwondo expert Jin Mo-Ri is invited to participate in the competition. There he befriends karate specialist Han Dae-Wi and swordswoman
                                               Yu Mi-Ra, who both have entered for their own personal reasons. Mo-Ri knows that no opponent will be the same and that the matches will 
                                               be the most ruthless he has ever fought in his life. But instead of being worried, this prospect excites him beyond belief.

                                               A secret lies beneath the facade of a transparent test of combat prowess the tournament claims to be—one that has Korean political candidate
                                                Park Mu-Jin watching every fight with expectant, hungry eyes. Mo-Ri, Dae-Wi, and Mi-Ra are about to discover what it really means to become
                                                 the God of High School.

                                            Yoichi Isagi was mere moments away from scoring a goal that would have sent his high school soccer team to the nationals, but a split-second decision to pass 
                                            the ball to his teammate cost him that reality. Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made 
                                            the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process,
                                             Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock.
                                              <br><br>
                                              The project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each
                                               diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to 
                                               the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.

                                            Ever since having witnessed the "Little Giant" and his astonishing skills on the volleyball court, Shouyou Hinata has been bewitched by the dynamic nature of
                                             the sport. Even though his attempt to make his debut as a volleyball regular during a middle school tournament went up in flames, he longs to prove that 
                                             his less-than-impressive height ceases to be a hindrance in the face of his sheer will and perseverance.
                                              <br><br>
                                              When Hinata enrolls in Karasuno High School, the Little Giant's alma mater, he believes that he is one step closer to his goal of becoming a professional 
                                              volleyball player. Although the school only retains a shadow of its former glory, Hinata's conviction isn't shaken until he learns that Tobio Kageyama—the
                                               prodigy who humiliated Hinata's middle school volleyball team in a crushing defeat—is now his teammate.
                                               <br><br>
                                               To fulfill his desire of leaving a mark on the realm of volleyball—so often regarded as the domain of the tall and the strong—Hinata must smooth out his
                                                differences with Kageyama. Only when Hinata learns what it takes to be a part of a team will he be able to join the race to the top in earnest.

                                            After five years of harboring unspoken feelings, high-schooler Taiju Ooki is finally ready to confess his love to Yuzuriha Ogawa. Just when Taiju begins
                                             his confession however, a blinding green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world—turning every single human into stone.
                                              <br><br>
                                              Several millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent, as nature has flourished in the years humanity stood still. 
                                              Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months. 
                                              Taiju learns that Senkuu has developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of civilization with science. Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains
                                               combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified.

                                               However, Senkuu's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken. All the while, the reason for mankind's 
                                               petrification remains unknown.

                                               detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they 
                                               solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their

                                            Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's 
                                            said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was 
                                            born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once told him, "You have no enemies, 
                                            nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt," as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.

                                              The war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are 
                                              loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make 
                                              names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the 
                                              man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.

                                            Hunters devote themselves to accomplishing hazardous tasks, all from traversing the world's uncharted territories to locating rare items and 
                                            monsters. Before becoming a Hunter, one must pass the Hunter Examination—a high-risk selection process in which most applicants end up 
                                            handicapped or worse, deceased.

                                              Ambitious participants who challenge the notorious exam carry their own reason. What drives 12-year-old Gon Freecss is finding Ging, his
                                               father and a Hunter himself. Believing that he will meet his father by becoming a Hunter, Gon takes the first step to walk the same path.

                                                While their motives vastly differ from each other, they band together for a common goal and begin to venture into a perilous world.

                                             to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and 
                                             recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.

                                               newfound skills—notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level
                                                monster "Storm Dragon" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament,
                                                 Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection.

                                            All of a sudden, they arrived: parasitic aliens that descended upon Earth and quickly infiltrated humanity by burrowing into the brains of vulnerable targets. 
                                            These insatiable beings acquire full control of their host and are able to morph into a variety of forms in order to feed on unsuspecting prey.
                                              <br><br>
                                              Sixteen-year-old high school student Shinichi Izumi falls victim to one of these parasites, but it fails to take over his brain, ending up in his right hand
                                               instead. Unable to relocate, the parasite, now named Migi, has no choice but to rely on Shinichi in order to stay alive. Thus, the pair is forced into an
                                                uneasy coexistence and must defend themselves from hostile parasites that hope to eradicate this new threat to their species.

                                            Surrounded by a forest and a gated entrance, the Grace Field House is inhabited by orphans happily living together as one big family, looked after by their "Mama," 
                                            Isabella. Although they are required to take tests daily, the children are free to spend their time as they see fit, usually playing outside, as long as they
                                             do not venture too far from the orphanage—a rule they are expected to follow no matter what. However, all good times must come to an end, as every few months, 
                                             a child is adopted and sent to live with their new family, never to be heard from again.
                                              <br><br>
                                              However, the three oldest siblings have their suspicions about what is actually happening at the orphanage, and they are about to discover the cruel fate that
                                               awaits the children living at Grace Field, including the twisted nature of their beloved Mama.

                                            A sinister threat is invading Tokyo: flesh-eating "ghouls" who appear identical to humans and blend into their population. Reserved college student Ken Kaneki 
                                            buries his nose in books and avoids the news of the growing crisis. However, the appearance of an attractive woman named Rize Kamishiro shatters his solitude 
                                            when she forwardly asks him on a date.

                                              While walking Rize home, Kaneki discovers she isn't as kind as she first appeared, and she has led him on with sinister intent. After a tragic struggle, 
                                              he later awakens in a hospital to learn his life was saved by transplanting the now deceased Rize's organs into his own body.
                                              <br><br>
                                              Kaneki's body begins to change in horrifying ways, and he transforms into a human-ghoul hybrid. As he embarks on his new dreadful journey, Kaneki clings
                                               to his humanity in the evolving bloody conflict between society's new monsters and the government agents who hunt them.

                                            Brutal murders, petty thefts, and senseless violence pollute the human world. In contrast, the realm of death gods is a humdrum, unchanging gambling den. 
                                            The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student Light Yagami and sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their worlds are rotten.
                                              <br><br>
                                              For his own amusement, Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the first of its rules ridiculous: the human 
                                              whose name is written in this note shall die. However, the temptation is too great, and Light experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly
                                               enacts his first murder.
                                              <br><br>
                                              Aware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias Kira—follows his wicked sense of justice with the ultimate goal
                                               of cleansing the world of all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective L is already on his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand 
                                               chase for Kira turns into an intense battle of wits that can only end when one of them is dead.

                                            Having slept through all four of her alarms, the energetic Narumi Momose finds herself running late for her first day of work at a new office. As she races 
                                            to catch her train, she makes a promise to herself that none of her coworkers will find out about her dark secret: that she is an otaku and a fujoshi. 
                                            Her plan goes instantly awry, though, when she runs into Hirotaka Nifuji, an old friend from middle school. Although she tries to keep her secret by
                                             inviting him out for drinks after work, her cover is blown when he casually asks her whether or not she will be attending the upcoming Summer Comiket. 
                                             Luckily for her, the only witnesses—Hanako Koyanagi and Tarou Kabakura—are otaku as well.
                                              <br><br>
                                              Later that night, the pair go out for drinks so that they can catch up after all the years apart. After Narumi complains about her previous boyfriend
                                               breaking up with her because he refused to date a fujoshi, Hirotaka suggests that she try dating a fellow otaku, specifically himself. He makes a solemn
                                                promise to always be there for her, to support her, and to help her farm for rare drops in Monster Hunter. Blown away by the proposal, Narumi agrees 
                                                immediately. Thus the two otaku start dating, and their adorably awkward romance begins.

                                            The rare and inexplicable Puberty Syndrome is thought of as a myth. It is a rare disease which only affects teenagers, and its symptoms are so supernatural
                                             that hardly anyone recognizes it as a legitimate occurrence. However, high school student Sakuta Azusagawa knows from personal experience that it is very
                                              much real, and happens to be quite prevalent in his school.

                                              Mai Sakurajima is a third-year high school student who gained fame in her youth as a child actress, but recently halted her promising career for reasons 
                                              unknown to the public. With an air of unapproachability, she is well known throughout the school, but none dare interact with her—that is until Sakuta sees
                                               her wandering the library in a bunny girl costume. Despite the getup, no one seems to notice her, and after confronting her, he realizes that she is 
                                               another victim of Puberty Syndrome. As Sakuta tries to help Mai through her predicament, his actions bring him into contact with more girls afflicted 
                                               with the elusive disease.

                                            Hachiman Hikigaya is an apathetic high school student with narcissistic and semi-nihilistic tendencies. He firmly believes that joyful youth is nothing but
                                             a farce, and everyone who says otherwise is just lying to themselves.

                                            Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day. Raised together as children, they came to know of the "Wizard King"—a title given to the strongest 
                                            mage in the kingdom—and promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up, the stark difference
                                             between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers 
                                             by training physically.
                                              <br><br>
                                              When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked
                                               by a person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without hope and on the
                                                brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno's voice. Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover
                                                 Grimoire, a "Black Clover" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the same 
                                                 goal—to become the Wizard King!

                                            In this magical world, one is easily identified as having magical abilities by a distinctive mark on their face. Those unable to practice magic are swiftly

                                            one arm and lifting a cream puff with the other. This aloof boy with superhuman strength—but no magical abilities—leads a quiet life with his father, far

                                              which would force everyone to accept him, or be persecuted forever. To protect his family, he enrolls in the prestigious Easton Magic Academy, which only 
                                              the most elite and gifted students are allowed to attend. Now, Mash must overcome his shortcomings as a magicless being and surpass the other students—relying 
                                              solely on his muscles.

                                            In the distant past, a war between humans and demons brought about widespread chaos and bloodshed. To put an end to this seemingly endless conflict, 
                                            Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.
                                              <br><br>
                                              In preparation for their king's return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos' identity
                                               when he reawakens. He reincarnates two millennia later, but to his surprise, he soon learns that the level of magic in the world has drastically waned 
                                               during his absence. Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently.
                                                His personality, his deeds, and even his legacy are all falsified—masked beneath the name of an impostor. This "lack" of common knowledge renders 
                                                him the academy's outlier—a misfit never before seen in history.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Despite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed. As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his

                                            From an early age, Haruka Sakura was made an outcast due to his unconventional appearance and lack of social skills. However, the rough treatment turned him 
                                            into a proficient fighter, which is now the only thing he prides himself on. Starting at Furin High School, where it is rumored that strength is valued over
                                             academics, Sakura has only one goal—taking the top spot.
                                              <br><br>
                                              Involved in a street brawl the day before his enrollment, Sakura happens to meet a group of his future schoolmates. Instead of the usual rejection, they 
                                              fight alongside him, demonstrating that what the school actually cares about is protecting the town of Makochi from any harm—hence why the students call 
                                              themselves "Bofurin." Surprised by the support and appreciation of the townspeople, Sakura has a hard time accepting their goodwill.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Though unfamiliar with kindness being shown to him, Sakura must learn to push past his discomfort when Bofurin is pitted against formidable enemies. After
                                                 experiencing the feeling of acceptance, he finds himself fighting for the sake of others for the first time.

                                            Takemichi Hanagaki's second year of middle school was the highest point in his life. He had respect, a gang of friends he could count on, and even a girlfriend.
                                             But that was twelve years ago. Today, he's a nobody: a washed-up nonentity made fun of by children and always forced to apologize to his younger boss. A sudden 
                                             news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang's cruel murder of the only girlfriend he ever had alongside her brother only adds insult to injury. Half a second before a 
                                             train ends his pitiful life for good, Takemichi flashes back to that same day 12 years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana.
                                              <br><br>
                                              After being forced to relive the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata's younger brother. Without thinking, he admits to his
                                               seeming death before flashing back to the past. Takemichi urges him to protect his sister before inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he is
                                                not dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though Takemichi can alter the flow of time. Given the chance to prevent his ex-girlfriend's 
                                                tragic death at the hands of the Tokyo Manji Gang, Takemichi decides to fly through time to change the course of the future.

                                            Fuutarou Uesugi is an ace high school student, but leads an otherwise tough life. His standoffish personality and reclusive nature have left him friendless,
                                             and his father is debt-ridden, forcing his family to scrape by.
                                              <br><br>
                                              One day during his lunch break, Uesugi argues with a female transfer student who has claimed "his seat," leading both of them to dislike each other. 
                                              That same day, he is presented with a golden opportunity to clear his family's debt: a private tutoring gig for a wealthy family's daughter, with a 
                                              wage of five times the market price. He accepts the proposal, but is horrified to discover that the client, Itsuki Nakano, is the girl he confronted earlier!
                                              <br><br>
                                              After unsuccessfully trying to get back on Itsuki's good side, Uesugi finds out that his problems don't end there: Itsuki is actually a quintuplet, so in 
                                              addition to her, he must also tutor her sisters—Miku, Yotsuba, Nino, and Ichika—who, despite the very real threat of flunking, want nothing to do with a tutor.
                                               However, his family's livelihood is on the line so Uesugi pushes on, adamant in his resolve to rid the sisters of their detest for studying and successfully 
                                               lead them to graduation.

                                             as far as seeing themselves capable of wielding mystical powers, or maybe even believe themselves to have descended from a fantasy realm. This "disease"
                                              is known as "chuunibyou" and is often the source of some of the most embarrassing moments of a person's life.
                                              <br><br>
                                              For Yuuta Togashi, the scars that his chuunibyou has left behind are still fresh. Having posed as the "Dark Flame Master" during his middle school years,
                                               he looks back at those times with extreme embarrassment, so much so that he decides to attend a high school far away where nobody will recognize him. 
                                               Putting his dark history behind him, he longs to live a normal high school life.

                                               young girl crashes into Yuuta's life, his dream of an ordinary, chuunibyou-free life quickly crumbles away. In this hilarious and heartwarming story of a 
                                               boy who just wants to leave his embarrassing memories behind, the delusions of old are far from a thing of the past.
